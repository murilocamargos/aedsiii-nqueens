# N-Queens
In chess, a queen can move as far as she pleases, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A chess board has 8 rows and 8 columns. The standard 8 by 8 Queen's problem asks how to place 8 queens on an ordinary chess board so that none of them can hit any other in one move [[source]](http://www.math.utah.edu/~alfeld/queens/queens.html). The solution implements the Hill-Climbing algorithm.
